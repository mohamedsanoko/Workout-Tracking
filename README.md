# Workout Tracker
This Python script allows users to input exercises they performed and logs the workout details into a Google Sheet using the Sheety API. It utilizes the Nutritionix API for exercise data and interacts with the Google Sheet through the Sheety API.

# Getting Started
  1. Clone the Repository.
  2. Install Dependencies (Python, required libraries).
  3. Set Up Environment Variables (API Keys, authentication tokens).
  4. Run the Script.

# Project Structure
The project consists of a single Python script. This script prompts the user to input exercises, sends the input to the Nutritionix API for exercise data, and logs the workout details into a Google Sheet using the Sheety API.

# How It Works
  1. The script prompts the user to input exercises they performed.
  2. It sends the input to the Nutritionix API, which returns exercise data.
  3. The script logs the workout details, including the date, time, exercise name, duration, and       calories, into a Google Sheet using the Sheety API.

# Customization
**API Keys and Endpoints:** Replace the placeholder API keys and endpoints with your actual Nutritionix API key and ID, Sheety authentication token, and Sheety API endpoint.

# Notes
The project includes placeholders for API keys and environment variables. Replace these placeholders with your actual API keys and details.

The script utilizes the Nutritionix API for exercise data and the Sheety API for logging workout details into a Google Sheet.
